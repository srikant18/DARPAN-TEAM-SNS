# DARPAN-TEAM-SNS:
We propose to have a gadget which is the reconciliation of various gadgets, the hardware part of this device involves a wearable safety locket and a wearable safety band. We have named this project as “DARPAN”. The total device additionally guarantees to give self-preservation application which encourages women to get away from critical situations. 

# Working:
**our heart reacts differently in different situations like anxiety, panic our bpm reaches more than 160bpm so we used that idea in our safety device. when pulse rate sensor record bpm, more than 160 node MCU (wrist band) will trigger up GPS module to detect the location of the crime scene, and so on Arduino(locket) will be triggered up. components connected with it such as camera connected capture image and recorder will record the voice of culprits the captured data will be sent to AWS/Other cloud-based server which can act as evidence. Additionally, a buzzer is connected which will alert people nearby.so that people who are nearby can help out.
Further, the captured will be recognized with our face recognition algorithm so that culprits can easily identify.**
